# AutoLotDAL

This is a simple library based on Andrew Troelsen's book "Pro C# and the .NET 4.0 Framework", chapter 21 and 22. Its only destination is connection to training database, AutoLot. Andrew Troelsen use it in next chapters to show some functionalities, so it's good to have it while learning about ASP or WPF.
Original library was written to work with Microsoft SQL Server. I needed version working with MySQL for some reasons, so I decided to re-write it and put it here. Of course, changees are very easy to apply, so my work wasn't hard.

I'll also try to include to this project some tips ans solutiuons how to easy prepare MySQL and MONO under Debian to make exercise from this book.
